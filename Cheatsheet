Troubleshoot
If you receive this error message If you have previously trusted your certificate using Keychain, please set the Trust setting back to the system default
do not panic!
Perform the following steps:
Enter Xcode and delete your account from "Preferences"
Go to ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning in finder and delete the files in it
Enter the keychain and delete all personal certificates that mention Mac Developer, iOS Developer, etc.
Re-add your account to Xcode and choose to revoke the existing certificate (if you can’t revoke, please keep the certificate)
Go to xcode and try to install the virtual application to the device. This step will trigger Apple to generate a new our certificate.
Then, open the iOS App Signer
